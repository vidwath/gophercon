   <p class="d">The Go Conference in Dubai.<br/>
   Go is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community.

   Go makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

   This conference is brought to you by the Go Language Community in Dubai together with the Emerging Technology Trust (ETT). ETT is a non-profit organization, established to organize and conduct technology conferences in Dubai. It's current portfolio includes DeccanRuby Conf, DevOpsDays Dubai, GopherCon Dubai and RubyConf Dubai.

   We love going to conferences that don't make you choose between two great presentations. So we created GopherConDubai as a single-track event that you don't want to miss and where everyone gets the opportunity to see the same talks. We think you'll enjoy the speakers we're lining up so much, you won't want to miss anyone of them. Friday and Saturday will offer full days of conference sessions.<br /><br />

   Note: The conference is entirely in English.</p>

      <div class="heading">Gophercon Workshop</div>
      <p class="d">GopherConDubai 2016 is proud to work with Ardan Labs to bring to you a full day of the Hardcore Go workshop on Thursday, 18th Feb. 2016, a day before the actual GopherConDubai conference.<br />This is a 1 day class for any level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go's type system, concurrency, channels and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals. We would love to have you attend this paid workshop. Lunch and snacks will be provided.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> The proceeds of the Go workshop will go towards part-funding the conference.<br/><br/>

            Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo. By the 1960s Dubai's economy was based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller extent, oil exploration concessions, but oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969.Dubai's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.The emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events. The city has become symbolic for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.</span></p>
